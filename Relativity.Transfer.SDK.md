[![nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Relativity.Transfer.SDK.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Relativity.Transfer.SDK)

The Relativity Transfer .NET SDK package.

## v2.1.0

### Release Notes

#### Breaking changes:
- `AzureTransferFullPathClientBuilder` and `AzureTransferJobClientBuilder` now require a workspace context, which can be specified by the workspace's ID or using Staging Explorer privileges.
- Cancelled directory transfers will no longer throw `OperationCancelledException`. Instead, a result with a "Cancelled" state will be returned.
- If the client's implementation of `IRelativityAuthenticationProvider` throws an exception, the SDK will now throw a `FailedToAcquireCredentialsException`.
- Support for legacy fileshares has been discontinued since all clients have successfully migrated to the new storage.

#### New Features and Improvements:
- Introduced `OvewritePolicy` in `OptionsBase` for implementing policies to handle file skipping and overwriting at the destination.
- `AzureTransferJobClient` now supports uploading a list of files to the fileshare.
- Added the ability to specify the location of journal files in transfer options.
- Improved handling of I/O errors on Windows for better reliability and troubleshooting.
- Transfer SDK will now automatically remove journal files older than 28 days to optimize storage.
