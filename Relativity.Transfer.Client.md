> **NOTE**: Relativity.Transfer.Client versions 7.4.10 and below **will stop functioning on January 31, 2024**, due to the migration of Relativity data transfer products to cloud-based solutions.

>**Check out Relativity.Transfer.SDK ([NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Relativity.Transfer.SDK/)), a successor of this library. It works with all types of fileshares, it's faster and simpler in use!**
>
> Since it is going to be **a breaking change** you will need to **update your code** and integrate with the **Relativity.Transfer.SDK**, version 1.0.0+
>
> On December 5th, 2022 we have released the first version (1.0.3) including:
> * Upload a single file or a directory to the RelativityOne fileshare 
> * Track data transfer progress (including files that were transferred, skipped or failed, with their source and destination path)
> * Recover transfer from previous failure or interruption 
> * Real time information about succeeded, failed and skipped items, including exact path and the reason of error 
> * Cross platform compatibility - you can transfer data from Windows, Linux and macOS 
> * Secured transfer using HTTPS, only single TCP 443 is required 
>
> Q1 2023 you can expect additional functionalities like: 
> * Download a single file or a directory from the RelativityOne fileshare 
> * File retry policy 
> * File exclusion policy  
> * File override policy  
> * File custom attributes policy (used to set custom metadata on target file)
